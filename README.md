.Net Core native library for reading ILDA Laser show files

**Work in progress** so no guarantees on production stability.

This library is an early version of an ILDA parser that i am using in my own project, however i decided to make it public for anyone who might find it usefull.
I have only implemented ILDA Version Type 5 and Ilda Version Type 4 - I will implement the other versions when i need to do that for my other project.

This project will continued to be maintained and transformed into a stable library as i experiment with the implementation.
